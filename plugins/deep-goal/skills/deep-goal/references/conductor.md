# Conductor — dispatch protocol, advance test, blocker policy

How the conductor actually walks the pipeline: the launch sequence (re-entry first), the inline planning window, the per-stage dispatch loop, the artifact-verification **advance test**, the severity-aware **blocker policy**, and the run's bookends — resume and the final run report (§ 7 summary; spec in `references/resume-and-report.md`). SKILL.md § Workflow is the summary; this file is the protocol.

Two invariants frame everything here (contract rows #3 and #4 of the plan's State/Data-Flow Contract):

- **`00-Manifest/pipeline.md` is the conductor's state file** — conductor-written only, updated at every stage boundary, and the single thing a re-invocation needs to resume. Its shape is `templates/pipeline.md`.
- **The conductor is READ-ONLY on manifest stage lines.** Each core skill flips its own line in `00-Manifest/manifest.md`; the conductor reads those flips as evidence and never writes one. (Its only manifest write, ever, is the effort summary paragraph at run completion — § 7.)

## 1. Launch sequence

Run these in order, once, before anything is dispatched. Everything resolved here is persisted into `pipeline.md` and **never re-derived mid-run**.

1. **Re-entry check — FIRST, before everything.** Does the invocation target an effort whose `00-Manifest/pipeline.md` already exists — or is it a bare "resume"? → the **re-entry protocol** (`references/resume-and-report.md` § 1): announce prior state and ask resume/fresh as one self-contained question. **Resume skips the rest of this sequence** — prior state is re-read from the pipeline.md header, never re-derived; **fresh** archives the old pipeline.md (`pipeline-archived-<n>.md`) and falls through here. No prior pipeline.md → continue. (`--dry-run` never re-enters.)
2. **Rigor resolution** — merge shipped `templates/rigor-map.json` with any `.deep-skills/rigor-map.json` override, validate, resolve the level (or ask), per SKILL.md § Rigor resolution and `references/rigor-levels.md`. On `--dry-run`: print the preview and **stop here** — no handshake, no writes.
3. **Version handshake** — locate the installed deep-skills plugin (§ 1a below), read its `plugin.json` `version`, require ≥ 0.2.0 as semver; refuse / warn / proceed per SKILL.md § Launch. Record the resolved plugin.json path and version outcome in the `pipeline.md` header.
4. **Effort slug** — the conductor derives the kebab-case slug from the goal:
   - **yolo / poc** (autonomous planning): the derived slug is final — it is passed to the planner as `deep-plan --autonomous --effort=<slug>`, which uses it verbatim (deep-plan's autonomous-mode contract). State it; never ask.
   - **mvp / prod** (interactive planning): the derived slug is a *proposal* — deep-plan's own inline Setup step proposes it and the **user confirms** (or renames) as usual. Nothing is created until the name is confirmed.
5. **Effort dir + manifest** — once the slug is final/confirmed, create `.deep-skills/<effort>/` and `00-Manifest/manifest.md` **if absent**, in the exact format of `references/artifact-structure.md` § Manifest format, all stage statuses `pending`. (Creating the manifest is allowed — the read-only rule covers *flipping* stage lines, which only core skills do.)
6. **Initial `pipeline.md`** — write `00-Manifest/pipeline.md` from `templates/pipeline.md`: full header (goal, rigor + source, resolved deep-skills location + version outcome, gates/budget/worktree), the resolved stage list with per-stage dispatch modes and invocations, the **artifact baseline** (what already exists at each stage's canonical path at this moment — § 4 defines it and judges every advance test against it; all-absent on a virgin effort), one dispatch record per planned dispatch (all `pending`), empty Blockers, zero spend. **Pipeline state exists from launch** — a crash at any later point, including mid-planning, is resumable from this file (`references/resume-and-report.md` § 1 owns the resume walk; this file is what it reads).

At mvp/prod, steps 5–6 execute the moment the effort name is confirmed at the top of the inline planning window — *before* any question round — so the long interactive session is crash-covered too.

### 1a. Locating the installed deep-skills plugin (per host)

Consolidated here from SKILL.md § Launch (which keeps the summary). Resolve **once** at launch; persist the resolved `plugin.json` path in `pipeline.md`.

- **Claude Code** (and **Copilot CLI**, which consumes the same marketplace format): installed plugins live under `~/.claude/plugins/`. Read `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` — its `plugins` map is keyed `<plugin>@<marketplace>`; find the key beginning `deep-skills@`, take its entry's `installPath`, and read `<installPath>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. If that index file is absent or unreadable, fall back to globbing `~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/deep-skills/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and take the most recently modified match.
- **Codex**: look for a `deep-skills` plugin root installed as a **sibling of deep-goal's own install** (both come from the same store; the vendored unit is the plugin root) and read its `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` (or its `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — Codex also accepts the Claude manifest as a compat source; see `HOSTS.md`, RE-VERIFY per current Codex docs).
- **Cursor**: same sibling-install check under Cursor's plugin store; for local dev installs check `~/.cursor/plugins/local/deep-skills/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` (see `HOSTS.md`).
- **Copilot / VS Code editor** (file-based, no marketplace): the skills location the user configured (`chat.agentSkillsLocations` or `.github/skills/`) points into a checkout that carries the sibling `plugins/deep-skills/` root — read its `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` from there.
- **Any host, last resort**: this skill's own file path is known at runtime — check whether a `deep-skills/` plugin root sits **beside deep-goal's plugin root** (siblings under the same install parent). If deep-skills still cannot be located, ask the user where it is installed before refusing.

The resolved location also supplies `{skill_path}` for every stage briefing: a dispatched skill's SKILL.md sits at `<deep-skills plugin root>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.

## 2. The planning window

Planning is the **interactivity boundary**: all human interaction happens here; **autonomy starts when `01-Plan/plan.md` exists.**

Branch on the plan stage's `mode` in the resolved map:

- **`autonomous`** (shipped: yolo, poc) — a dispatched stage like any other: render the stage briefing for `deep-plan --autonomous --effort=<slug>`, appending `--columbo` when the stage entry has `"columbo": true`, and launch one fresh subagent. The user sees nothing until it's done. (`--columbo` folds into the *same* dispatch — core defines it as a flag of the planning run itself, self-run at the end; it is never a second dispatch.)
- **`interactive`** (shipped: mvp, prod) — the conductor runs `/deep-plan` **inline in the main session** (the user is present by definition — a background agent can't ask questions), passing `--rounds=<n>` from the stage entry's `rounds` and honoring `columbo` per the map; deep-plan's own workflow drives name confirmation, the front-loaded question rounds, optional gap rounds, and the pre-write nudge.

**Every stage — inline or dispatched — gets a `pipeline.md` dispatch record.** Mark the planning record `in-flight` when the window opens (dispatch launched, or inline session started). The planning record's completion test is deliberately simple: **it completes when `01-Plan/plan.md` exists** — judged against the launch baseline like every advance test (§ 4), so a plan.md that survived a fresh restart completes the record only once the planner has (re)written it. That moment is the autonomy boundary — from here on the conductor asks no unsolicited questions; it only notifies (halts, gates, budget pauses, completion) and, at user-injected `--gate`s or budget ceilings, waits.

## 3. The dispatch loop

For each remaining stage in the resolved list, in order:

1. **Guard:** exactly **one stage in flight at a time.** Before launching, confirm no other record is `in-flight`, then mark this record `in-flight` with its start time. (If deep-goal is re-invoked while a record is `in-flight`, announce the running stage instead of double-dispatching; full resume — including the re-entry edition of this guard — is `references/resume-and-report.md` § 1.)
2. **Render the briefing:** fill `templates/stage-briefing.md` — substitute `{skill_name}` (from the merged map's `known_stages.<stage>.skill`), `{skill_path}` (from the launch-resolved deep-skills location), `{effort_name}`, `{stage_flags}` (per the invocation table below), and `{worktree_path}` (the conductor-created worktree on `--worktree` runs, else the none-form — both renderings: `references/loop-and-budget.md` § 5 and the template's comment block). The rendered text is the subagent's **entire prompt** — nothing else rides along, no transcripts, no plan excerpts; the briefed agent reads the skill's own SKILL.md and the effort's artifacts.
3. **Dispatch:** launch **one fresh subagent** at the session model (no model tiering here — fleet skills self-tier via their own `model-map.md`). Await completion. Never dispatch two stages concurrently, never reuse a stage's agent for the next stage.
4. **Advance test** (§ 4): verify artifacts and manifest evidence — never the subagent's closing narrative. Pass → complete the record (finished time, advance-test result, spend estimate from `references/rigor-levels.md` § Cost bands — refined by observed usage where the host surfaces it, always labeled an estimate) and continue. Fail → inspect for a blocker artifact and apply the blocker policy (§ 5).
5. **Boundary checks** before looping to the next stage: round accounting + convergence when inside the review→fix loop (§ 6), then the **budget check** (`--budget` runs), then the **gate check** (`--gate` before the next stage) — full order and pause procedures in `references/loop-and-budget.md` § 6. A pause always lands *between* stages, never mid-stage.

**Empty-set skips (review→fix loop only):** two loop dispatches are conditional on work existing in `findings.json` — `code-review (triage)` is **skipped** when zero findings are `open`, and `bugfix` is **skipped** when zero findings are `accepted`-and-not-`fixed` (dispatching deep-bugfix with nothing actionable strands an autonomous agent that is forbidden to ask for input, and the advance test would then HALT a healthy run). A skipped record is marked `complete` straight from `pending` with advance test `skipped — …`, and a skipped bugfix ends the loop by cap. Spec: `references/loop-and-budget.md` § 1.5.

**Idempotency:** because the advance test is artifact-based and launch-relative (§ 4), an accidental re-dispatch is harmless — if the expected artifact already exists **new against the baseline** and the manifest line is already flipped, mark the record complete and move on without dispatching. An artifact the baseline shows pre-existed never triggers this rule — a fresh restart's surviving stages, or a pre-run manual skill's artifacts, are not this run's work. **Exception:** review rounds ≥ 2 in the review→fix loop (`04-Code-Review/` artifacts are not round-versioned, so bare existence is vacuously true from round 2) use the **round-aware test** — pre-dispatch findings.json snapshot vs fresh CR ids / status changes / updated `reviewed` date — specified with the loop controller in `references/loop-and-budget.md` § 1.2.

### Stage → invocation table

What `{stage_flags}` renders to, per stage entry in the resolved map. Skills are invoked **by name** (the house cross-skill precedent); explicit artifact paths are passed where a skill accepts one, so "latest" never has to be guessed.

| Stage entry | Dispatch(es) | Invocation (`{skill_name}` + `{stage_flags}`) |
|---|---|---|
| `plan`, `mode: autonomous` | 1 subagent | `deep-plan` — `<goal> --autonomous --effort=<slug>` + `--columbo` if `columbo: true` |
| `plan`, `mode: interactive` | inline | `deep-plan` — `<goal> --rounds=<rounds>` (+ columbo per map; user present) |
| `plan-review` | 1 subagent | `deep-plan-review` — `.deep-skills/<effort>/01-Plan/plan.md` + `--multi-agent` if `mode: multi-agent` |
| `implement` | 1 subagent | `deep-implement` — `.deep-skills/<effort>/01-Plan/plan.md --autonomous` |
| `code-review` (the review) | 1 subagent | `deep-code-review` — current branch + `--multi-agent` if `mode: multi-agent` (single-agent is core's default; no flag) |
| `code-review` → `triage` option | 1 **more** subagent | `deep-code-review` — `--triage --auto-accept-min=<triage.auto_accept_min>` |
| `bugfix` | 1 subagent | `deep-bugfix` — `.deep-skills/<effort>/04-Code-Review/findings.json --autonomous` |
| `docs` | 1 subagent | `deep-docs` — effort mode (the effort is named in the briefing; deep-docs' intake resolves it) |

**Why triage is a second dispatch of the same skill (and columbo isn't):** the rigor map encodes both as *per-stage options, not standalone stages* — that is a statement about the **data shape and the artifact contract** (triage writes the same `04-Code-Review/` artifacts and has **no manifest line of its own**), and it matches *how core exposes them*. And core exposes them differently: `--columbo` is a flag **of the planning run** (self-run at its end — one invocation), while `--triage` is a **separate opt-in invocation** of deep-code-review that runs *only* the triage step and "never re-runs the review" (deep-code-review SKILL.md § 7 / § Flags) — core defines no combined review+triage invocation, and deep-goal never requires core changes. Separate dispatches also buy exactly what the plan values in rejecting the `--fix` triage+bugfix fusion: a per-dispatch spend record, a fresh agent per step, and the clean triage boundary the loop's per-round accounting hangs on (`references/loop-and-budget.md` § 1.3). So one `code-review` stage entry with a `triage` option expands to **two consecutive dispatch records** in `pipeline.md` (`code-review`, then `code-review (triage)`); a `code-review` entry *without* the option (custom overrides) expands to one, and triage falls to the user.

## 4. The advance test

After every dispatch (and the inline planning window), the conductor verifies, itself, with its own reads:

> **The expected artifact exists at its canonical path AND the skill flipped its own manifest stage line.**

Never advance on the subagent's word — a closing message is not evidence. Canonical paths and manifest line names are the series contract (`references/artifact-structure.md`).

**Judged against the launch baseline, always.** Efforts are not always virgin: a fresh restart archives *only* pipeline state (`references/resume-and-report.md` § 1.2 — the manifest, plan, and stage artifacts survive), and a stage skill may have been run manually before deep-goal ever saw the effort. Against such artifacts, absolute predicates lie in both directions — bare existence is vacuously true for stages that never ran, and "findings statuses all `open`" is false for a review that ran perfectly (appends preserve prior statuses by contract). So the launch sequence (§ 1 step 6) records the **artifact baseline** in `pipeline.md` (`templates/pipeline.md` § Artifact baseline): for each canonical artifact, `absent` or present-with-mtime — plus, where present, findings.json's max CR id · count · `reviewed` date · findings/certificate mtimes, the highest pre-existing `06-Bug-Fix/round-K/`, and the manifest's stage statuses at launch. In the table below, **"exists" means exists new against that baseline** — absent at launch, or mtime strictly newer than the baseline's — and **"flipped" means changed from its baseline status** (a line already `complete` at launch is inconclusive evidence; the artifact half of the test carries alone). On a virgin effort the baseline is all-absent and every check reduces to its plain reading — round-1 behavior over a clean effort is unchanged. § 1.5 **skips are exempt**: a skipped record is a conductor decision that writes no artifacts and is never judged against the baseline (or any artifact) at all.

The exact per-stage checks:

| Stage record | Expected artifact (canonical path, under `.deep-skills/<effort>/`) | Manifest evidence (`00-Manifest/manifest.md`) |
|---|---|---|
| `plan` | `01-Plan/plan.md` exists | none required — **plan.md's existence is the test** (the autonomy boundary; deep-plan flips `01 Plan` as usual, but the record completes on the artifact) |
| `plan-review` | `02-Plan-Review/review.md` exists | `02 Plan Review` flipped to `complete` |
| `implement` | `03-Implementation/summary.md` exists | `03 Implementation` flipped to `complete` |
| `code-review` (review) | `04-Code-Review/report.md` + `findings.json` + `certificate.md` all exist; every finding **this round appended** is `open` — that is all of them when the baseline shows no `findings.json`; over a pre-existing one (fresh restart, manual prior review) the appended set is the CR ids above the baseline's max, prior statuses are preserved by the append contract and never fail this test, and the whole row is judged as the **round-aware test** (`loop-and-budget.md` § 1.2) with the launch baseline as its snapshot | `04 Code Review` flipped by the skill |
| `code-review (triage)` | **no manifest line of its own** — test reads the artifacts triage rewrites: `04-Code-Review/findings.json` has **zero `open` statuses** (each finding now `accepted` / `deferred` / `rejected by user` — the exact literals) AND `certificate.md`'s **Triage outcomes** table is filled (no longer "Triage pending") | n/a (triage also updates the Code Review status per its own workflow, but the findings.json + certificate check is the test) |
| `bugfix` | `06-Bug-Fix/round-N/fix-summary.md` exists in the highest `round-N/`, with N **above the baseline's highest pre-existing round dir** (any N when the baseline shows none — rounds are append-only, so a prior run's round dir never passes for a bugfix that did not run) | `06 Bug Fix` flipped by the skill |
| `docs` | in-repo `docs/ai-map/` published (`MAP.md` + `index.json`) and the `07-Docs/` pointer present | `07 Docs` flipped to `complete` |

- **Review rounds ≥ 2** replace the code-review/triage rows with the **round-aware test** (fresh CR ids or status changes AND an updated `reviewed` date vs the pre-dispatch snapshot) — `references/loop-and-budget.md` § 1.2 specifies it; never use bare artifact existence there.
- On **pass**: append/complete the dispatch record and move to the next stage.
- On **fail**: do not advance and do not blindly re-dispatch — look for the stage's blocker artifact (§ 5 table) and classify. A failed advance test with *no* blocker artifact means the stage died mid-flight (crash, context loss): leave the record `in-flight`-annotated per `templates/pipeline.md` and re-dispatch once; the core skills' own internal resume (phase summaries, round scope, `--refresh`) makes that safe. Fails again → treat as a HALT-class blocker with a note that no blocker report exists.

## 5. Blocker policy (severity-aware)

A blocker is a stage saying "a human is needed." The conductor classifies by **where in the spine it happened**, not by who reported it: upstream ("spine") blockers poison every later stage — halting is cheaper than reviewing rubble; tail blockers are self-contained — the run finishes and reports them loudly.

| Blocker | Where it shows up | Class | Conductor action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plan-review **Blocker verdict** (verdict line reports `Blockers: N`, N > 0) | `02-Plan-Review/review.md` verdict line + Blockers section | **spine** | **HALT + notify** — downstream would implement a plan with known fatal flaws |
| Implement **phase blocked at the fix cap** (2 attempts) | ⛔ Blocker report appended to `01-Plan/plan.md` § Phase Summaries (deep-implement's `templates/blocker-report.md`; broken code never committed) | **spine** | **HALT + notify** — later stages would review rubble |
| Bugfix **unproven cluster at the fix cap** (reverted) | `06-Bug-Fix/round-N/blocker-<CL-K>.md` (one per blocked cluster) | **tail** | **CONTINUE + record** — clusters are independent; other clusters' fixes stand |
| Docs **anchor drift blocks publish** (`drifted` / `over-budget` anchors) | the drift record: `docs/ai-map/coverage.md` + the drifted-anchor list in `docs/ai-map/learn-signal.json` | **tail** | **CONTINUE + record** — a docs-only failure never invalidates the built code |

**Either way, `pipeline.md` carries the blocker-report path** (Blockers table row: stage · policy · report path · one-line note), and the final run report (§ 7; `references/resume-and-report.md` § 2) lists every blocker with its path.

**HALT procedure:** mark the stage's dispatch record `halted` (with the advance-test result), append the Blockers row with policy `HALT`, **notify**, and stop — dispatch nothing further. Do not archive or unwind anything: the halted `pipeline.md` *is* the resume point (a re-invocation re-enters at the halted stage once the human unblocks it — `references/resume-and-report.md` § 1.3).

**CONTINUE procedure:** record the blocker (Blockers row, policy `CONTINUE`) and proceed to the next stage. The stage's own record reflects its actual outcome: `complete` when its advance test still passed (bugfix with one blocked cluster among fixed ones — `fix-summary.md` exists and the manifest flipped), `halted` when it didn't (docs publish blocked by drift) — `halted` on a record means *the stage* stopped, the Blockers row's policy column says whether *the run* did. No mid-run notification for CONTINUE blockers — they ride the completion notification and the run report (the notify-sparingly rule: halts, gates, budget pauses, completion only).

**Notification mechanics:** one line, < 200 chars, lead with the actionable fact and the blocker-report path, via the host fallback chain (native, e.g. Claude Code PushNotification → shell `osascript` → bold `ATTENTION:` line as the last line of the turn — the series' host-affordances convention). Example:

> `deep-goal halted: implement blocked at Phase 2 (fix cap) — see .deep-skills/<effort>/01-Plan/plan.md § Phase Summaries. Re-invoke deep-goal to resume once unblocked.`

The full trigger set — **halts (blocker or convergence), gates, budget pauses, completion — and nothing else** — with per-trigger example lines lives in `references/loop-and-budget.md` § 4; halts use the mechanics above.

## 6. The review→fix loop (summary)

Spec: `references/loop-and-budget.md` § 1. **Round 1** is the map's own `code-review` (+ its triage option, a second dispatch) and `bugfix` stages, tested per § 4. **Re-review rounds (≥ 2)** append records `code-review (round N)` — plus `code-review (triage, round N)` and `bugfix (round N)` when the loop continues — reuse the level's `code-review` stage entry verbatim (same mode, same threshold), and use the **round-aware advance test** (pre-dispatch snapshot of findings.json's CR ids / count / `reviewed` date, taken when the record goes `in-flight`). Every round, both post-review dispatches are subject to the **empty-set short-circuit** (spec § 1.5): zero `open` findings → triage is skipped; zero `accepted`-and-not-`fixed` findings → bugfix is skipped and the loop exits by cap (cap 0 → next map stage; cap ≥ 1 → certificate PASS → exit to docs, FAIL → HALT — and a re-review of an unchanged tree is never dispatched). Skipped records go `complete` with advance test `skipped — …`, never a Blockers row. After each round the conductor appends the round's **non-`fixed` findings count** to pipeline.md's Review loop table.

Exit semantics key off the level's **`re_review_cap`, read from the resolved map — never a hard-coded literal**:

- **cap 0** — loop ends after round 1's bugfix; residual `deferred` findings go to the run report.
- **cap 1** — exactly one re-review; **HALT** only on unresolved Blockers (certificate FAIL), else **exit to docs** with round-2 residuals (fresh `open` + all `deferred`) reported.
- **cap ≥ 2** — from round 2: exit on certificate **PASS** AND **strictly fewer** non-`fixed` findings than the prior round; fail with re-reviews remaining → triage → bugfix → next round; cap reached without convergence → **HALT + notify as a convergence failure**.

## 7. Re-entry & run completion (summary)

Spec: `references/resume-and-report.md`. **Re-entry** is the launch sequence's **first check** (§ 1 item 1): an invocation that finds an existing `00-Manifest/pipeline.md` announces prior state and asks **resume / fresh** as one self-contained question — resume re-enters at the **first dispatch record that is not `complete`** (a `pending` record re-runs its boundary checks — budget with the current ceiling, then any unapproved gate re-fires; an `in-flight` record whose artifacts pass the advance test is marked complete and skipped — the idempotency rule; one that fails is re-dispatched once, on the core skills' own internal resume; review rounds ≥ 2 judged by the round-aware test, never bare existence); fresh archives the old pipeline.md as `pipeline-archived-<n>.md` and relaunches. All persisted header state — rigor, stage list, deep-skills location, gates, budget, worktree — is **re-read, never re-derived**.

**Completion** — when the walk's last record is `complete`, in order: **write `00-Manifest/run-report.md`** (`templates/run-report.md`; contents spec `resume-and-report.md` § 2.2 — stages + commits, the plan's Assumptions **verbatim**, every `deferred` finding with severity from findings.json, every blocker with its report path, per-stage + total spend with the uncalibrated caveat, worktree + merge instructions when set) → **update the manifest effort summary paragraph** (the conductor's ONLY manifest write, ever) → **completion notification** (`loop-and-budget.md` § 4) → **deliver the full report as the closing message**. HALTed runs write no report; the halted pipeline.md is the resume point.

## 8. Hosts

Everything above assumes **Claude Code subagent affordances** (fresh background subagents with a supplied prompt) — the v1 designed-and-verified floor. On hosts without them (Codex / Cursor / Copilot), dispatch degrades to **inline sequential execution** per `HOSTS.md` — same stage order, same briefing content, same advance tests and pipeline.md records; honestly caveated (prod-rigor runs may hit context limits). Only this section's *mechanism* changes per host; the protocol does not.
